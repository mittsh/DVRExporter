# DVR Exporter (Paw Extension)

A [Paw Extension](http://luckymarmot.com/paw/extensions/) to export [DVR playback files](https://github.com/venmo/DVR) from Paw.

## Installation

Easily install this Paw Extension: [Install DVR Exporter](https://luckymarmot.com/paw/extensions/DVRExporter)

## Limitations

Right now DVR Exporter is incredibly naive. It always assumes that both the request body and response body are JSON objects, and that the filename always ends with `.json`.

## License
